# Ranord - Flutter Project
Hello everyone, how are you? May this new year bring you more happiness from God.

This time I want to introduce a Flutter-based mobile application for word randomization with just one click.

### Ranord - Technology
There are several packages that I used while developing the Ranord apps. All of them are available on the pub.dev website with the following details:
- [google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
- [english_words](https://pub.dev/packages/english_words)
- [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)
- [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons)

### Ranord - About
The Ranord project directory consists of 3 packages and 1 main.dart file as a starting point. Every package that I make I make a supporting component when creating the appearance of the application and the word randomization function :
- components
- models
- pages

### Ranord - Open Source
For those of you who want to develop this Ranord application even better, I invite you with a note that your goal is for good. Besides, if you really want to make this app commercial, please contact me.
